							<p><b>Vernacular - Katfe</b></p>
							<p>
								Led a team of Unity developers to build out a VR language learning application for the Oculus Launchpad. In 3 months, we developed a prototype that allows a user to order a drink in japanese using their voice. We utilized various NLP packages to integrate the speech recognition so that we can measure and grade a user’s performance. Our project was selected for a grant from Oculus in 2021, and we are actively working on more scenarios and experiences for our user’s to learn in.
							</p>

							<p><b>AmaranTime Arena</b></p>
							<p>
								Self-directed an Early Access VR Arcade Shooter that pushes the player to use their body, arsenal, and mastery over time to decimate the robot army onslaught. Players can choose to move with 3 different movement schemes, utilize 3 different types of weapons, and use special abilities including slowing down time! This game uses Unity as the game engine, and Blender for asset modeling. I managed contracting out 3D art and music and integrating those pieces into the game, along with coding the game mechanics for the game. An early look at the game can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPVXEKBisHU" target="_blank">here</a></span>
